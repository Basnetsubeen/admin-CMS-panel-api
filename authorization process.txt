1. send the login info to the login api
2. If login success, create JWTs
   a. accessJWT, store in the session table 
   so, that we dont need to login every 15 min 
   b. refreshJWT, store in the user table
3. returns token to the frontend
4. store token in the browser session
  a. accessJWT goes in the sessionStorage = store until the browser is open
  b. refresh goes in the localStorage = stores forever until we delete

  step 2: protect server
  1. Recieve accessJWT as a authorization header
  2. Verify if accessJWT is valid
  3. Verify if accessJWT exist in the session table
  4. Then, get the user info by email which is avaiable through jwt decode
  5. do next()
  6. If any of the step fails above, return unauthorization error message

  Front auto login
  case 1. when you are refreshing the same window
  case 2. when you open link to a new tab or come back and re visit the site
