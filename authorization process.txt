1. send the login info to the login api
2. If login success, create JWTs
   a. accessJWT, store in the session table 
   so, that we dont need to login every 15 min 
   b. refreshJWT, store in the user table
3. returns token to the frontend
4. store token in the browser session
  a. accessJWT goes in the sessionStorage = store until the browser is open
  b. refresh goes in the localStorage = stores forever until we delete
